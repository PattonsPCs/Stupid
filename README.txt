========================================
  Random Video Jumpscare Program
========================================

HOW TO DISTRIBUTE TO FRIENDS:
-----------------------------

1. Build the program in CLion (or using CMake)
2. Find the .exe file (usually in build/Release/ or build/Debug/)
3. Create a folder with:
   - Sutpid.exe (the program)
   - video.mp4 (your video file - rename it to "video.mp4")
4. Zip the folder and send it to your friend

IMPORTANT:
----------
- The video file MUST be named "video.mp4" and placed in the same folder as the .exe
- Your friend will need VLC Media Player installed for best performance (the program can install it automatically)
- The program works without VLC, but video playback will be slower

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
1. Run Sutpid.exe
2. A dependency installer will appear first (can be skipped)
3. Click "ON" to start - every second there's a 1/100 chance the video will play
4. Click "OFF" to stop and exit

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
-------------------
- Windows 10 or later
- VLC Media Player (optional but recommended - can be installed automatically)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
- If video doesn't play: Make sure "video.mp4" is in the same folder as Sutpid.exe
- If VLC installation fails: Install VLC manually from https://www.videolan.org/
- If Windows blocks the program: Right-click > Properties > Unblock (if downloaded from internet)

HAVE FUN! 😈
